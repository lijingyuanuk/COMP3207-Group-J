Cloud Application Development (COMP3207) 
Group Coursework Assignment (Demo Prototype): Maze: The Amazeing Adventures 
Prototype URL: amazeing-adventures.appspot.com

The game can be played by any user, but users with a google account can create new mazes, extend existing ones. They can also save their total score as well as having their usernames recorded in case of beating the best score for a maze.
Creating a maze:
A. Select the size of your maze. The initial one is 16*10. Players can both change the height and weight of your maze. Considering the suitable size of a maze, we limit the maximum size to 30*30.
B. Put items on your maze which includes gems, stamina potions, keys, but only one spawn point and maze exit.
C. Consider the suitable time to play your maze. The remaining time is calculated into your final score.
D. Thinkofanameforyourmaze.Ifamazedoesnothaveanameorthenameisalready in use, it cannot be saved and information will display on the status area to notify you about an invalid maze.
E. Any other problems (e.g. missing spawn) with your maze that stop it from being saved will be notified to you via the status bar.
Playing the maze:
A. Rules:
a. To be able to complete the maze, the player must collect all the keys before
using the exit.
b. The number of stamina potions indicates the remaining steps. If the number of
remaining steps reaches 0 the player will not be able to proceed and the game
is over. The number of remaining steps is calculated into the final score.
B. The clock in the status bar shows the remaining time. If there is no time left, the game
is over. The remaining seconds are calculated into the final score.
C. The player can both use keyboard direction keys and onscreen buttons to move the
character. Overview:
The project aims to stimulate the creativity of players. Users can play mazes, create their own and extend all other mazes. The incentives of this game are both to achieve the highest score and to create popular mazes. In this game, both the processes of playing in a maze and creating mazes can bring fun to players, especially when players spend time to design a functional maze and find the way to get the highest score by considering all aspects about the final score- the remaining steps, the remaining time and the number of collected gems. There are two options for creating a maze: either to create it from scratch or extending an existing maze. In order to encourage players to collect as many gems as possible each gem scores 100, which is relatively high compared to the remaining steps and time. Also in order to improve the competitiveness of the game, the web application has a page to show the top 10 players total scores. Help and instructions are provided for all users.
