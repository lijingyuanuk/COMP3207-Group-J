<h2>Quick log - hope someone's reading the README...</h2>
<p>Hey Group J. In last commit I have added compiled PIXI.js library so you do not have to compile it by yoursef if you do not want to. Its in the <strong>.js/pixi/pixi.js</strong> directory.</p>
<p>I have also added an helloWorld.html that shows how easy and fun is to use PIXI.js. Feel free to mess with it on your own local repo.</p>
<p>The directories (folders and files) structure is completly free to change, but bare in mind that we should decide ASAP how it will look like, cause every single change may broke our code.</p>
<p>That's all for now. <br \>Cheers!<br \>Maciej</p>
